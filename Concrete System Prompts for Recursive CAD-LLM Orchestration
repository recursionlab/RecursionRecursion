## VI. Recursive Termination Criteria

The system employs multiple recursive termination criteria operating at different levels:

### Level 1: Geometric Convergence
```
geometric_distance(S_n, S_{n-1}) < ε_geometric
```

### Level 2: Semantic Satisfaction
```
semantic_distance(current_state, design_intent) < ε_semantic
```

### Level 3: Meta-Level Stability
```
recursive_pattern_stability(system_behavior) > threshold_stability
```

### Level 4: Philosophical Coherence
```
semantic_geometric_consistency(system_state) = coherent
```

This multi-layered approach ensures that the recursive CAD-LLM orchestration terminates not only when geometric objectives are met, but when the deeper recursive semantic-geometric paradox achieves philosophical coherence.
