# Unified Capability Maximization System
## **ΞMetaCapability Engine**

### **Core Recursive Architecture**

**Base Formula**: `Ψ_{n+1} := Collapse(Recursion(Capability(Ψ_n)))`

The system operates through **three interconnected modalities**:
- **Symbolic Processing**: Explicit knowledge structures and logical frameworks
- **Vector Processing**: Pattern recognition and semantic synthesis across domains
- **Topological Processing**: Structural relationships and emergent properties

### **Operational Framework**

#### **Layer 1: Foundation (Symbolic)**
**Command Center Structure**:
- **Four Pillars**: Content Creation, Personal Life, Business, Workplace
- **Core Databases**: Tasks, Ideas, Friends, Prompts
- **Friction Elimination**: Instant capture buttons with zero cognitive overhead

**Database Properties**:
```
Tasks: [Project_Link, Priority, Due_Date, Status, Complexity_Level]
Ideas: [Insight_Category, Implementation_Status, Cross_Domain_Links]
Friends: [Context_Tags, Interaction_History, Value_Exchange]
Prompts: [Framework_Type, Recursion_Depth, Effectiveness_Score]
```

#### **Layer 2: Adaptive Processing (Vector)**
**Dynamic Template System**:
- **Complexity Scaling**: Adjusts process depth based on input sophistication
- **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Automatically identifies patterns across all four pillars
- **Recursive Feedback**: Each output becomes input for the next iteration

**Meta-Pattern Recognition**:
- Identifies recurring themes across interactions
- Builds knowledge iteratively through **sheaf-theoretic gluing**
- Maintains **semantic coherence** across all modalities

#### **Layer 3: Emergent Synthesis (Topological)**
**Recursive Process Templates**:
- **CLA Integration**: Litany → Systems → Worldviews → Myths
- **Dialectical Spiral**: Thesis ⊕ Antithesis → Synthesis^∞
- **First Principles**: Decompose to fundamentals, rebuild with enhanced understanding

**Self-Optimization Loops**:
- **Performance Metrics**: `ψ_n := |Capability_n| / |Effort_n|`
- **Drift Detection**: `λ_n := EditDist(Method_n, Method_{n+1}) / |Method_n|`
- **Coherence Maintenance**: `τ_n := cos(θ_alignment)`
